Release notes
Matters to consider. Or ignore at your own peril.


0.1
- refactored all mentions of Image to File and add non-image uploads (turned off by default)
  - added a migration which adds a field containing a simplified mime type.
  - the data-rich-image-id attributed added to inserted images has been renamed to data-rich-file-id
  - the image storage path has changed! in order to prevent possible conflicts with other attachments, the path Rich uses is now namespaced. rename your path from: /public/system/images to /public/system/rich_files
- added the rich_picker for Rails Admin and Formtastic (and, by extension, Active Admin)
  - this allows you to link to a Rich file without having to embed a full CKEditor instance
- localization
  - english and dutch included
- a list view mode, the default when viewing non-image files
  - can be toggled in the upper-right hand corner
  - override the default display mode using view_mode in your config hash (this can only be set per instance)
